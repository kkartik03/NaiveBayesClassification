# NaiveBayesClassification
Implementation of Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm from Scratch using Python3 on Iris Dataset.
The code is written from scratch and does not use advanced packages/functions which can provide Naive Bayes Classifier Class.

From GFG:
Naive Bayes is among one of the very simple and powerful algorithms for classification based on Bayes Theorem with an assumption of independence among the predictors. The Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a feature in a class is not related to any other feature. Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm for binary and multi-class classification problems.
